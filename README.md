# SortList

The `SortList` class stores an array of a predefined length containining a sequence of integers. This class is intended to be used for simulation purposes and should not be used in place of predefined list classes such as the ArrayList. The SortList class has methods that may be used to randomize a list of sequential elements and sort it using numerous sorting algorithms of varying efficiency. The verbosity of the sorting and randomization can be controlled through the use of boolean global variables.
